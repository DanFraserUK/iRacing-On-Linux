This short guide assumes a relatively fresh install of SteamOS on a Steam Deck, which includes Steam as already installed and an iRacing account that is not already activated in any way on Steam.

Switch to Steam Deck "desktop" mode.

Install Protontricks
    - flatpak install flathub com.github.Matoking.protontricks
    OR you can install it from the desktop environment "Discover" software library

Alias protontricks with the following two commands
    - alias protontricks='flatpak run com.github.Matoking.protontricks'
    - alias protontricks-launch='flatpak run --command=protontricks-launch com.github.Matoking.protontricks'

Install iRacing on Steam, note there are only three .bat files at the end of this.

Download the iRacing installer and place into an easy to locate directory if needed.
    https://members.iracing.com/download/member/noservice.jsp and click "Download iRacing Software"

run
    - protontricks-launch --appid 266410 [path to iRacing installer.exe]

Follow all the prompts, place the install location to where Steam installed iRacing
    - usually in Z:/home/$USER/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/iRacing
    make sure to check there is no double /iRacing/iRacing/

Once installed, for now select Proton Experimental as the Steam Play Compatibility tool - though GE-Proton9-5 does work.

I suggest always running the game from Desktop mode. I use a "Gamepad with Mouse Trackpad" steam controller configuration so I can use the mouse in the menus and click with the trackpad.

Click PLAY in Steam.
