<h1>iRacing On Linux</h1>

<h2>GAME STATUS: INOPERATIVE</h2>

A collaborative effort to record and document as much information about iRacing on Linux, peripherals, accompanying software, Linux distributions and more.

Each document regarding a certain distribution must be exclusive to that distribution, even if the upstream distribution is the same - for example clean Arch, Manjaro and EndeavourOS are all Arch however as they have different install processes they must not be combined.
