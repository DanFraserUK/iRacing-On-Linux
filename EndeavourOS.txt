This short guide assumes a fresh install of EndeavourOS which includes Steam as already installed and an iRacing account that is not already activated in any way on Steam.

[It has been a while since I did a fresh install]
Install protontricks
    - $ yay -S protontricks

Grab your Steam key here:

Install iRacing on Steam, note there are only three .bat files at the end of this.

Download the iRacing installer and place into an easy to locate directory if needed.

run
    - protontricks-launch --appid 266410 [path to installer]

Follow all the prompts, place the install location to where Steam installed iRacing
    - usually in /home/$USER/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/iRacing
    make sure to check there is no double /iRacing/iRacing/

Once installed, for now select Proton Experimental as the Steam Play Compatibility tool - though GE-Proton9-5 does work.

Click PLAY.
