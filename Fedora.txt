This short guide assumes a fresh install of Fedora Workstation 40 (with required gfx drivers) which includes Steam as already installed and an iRacing account that is not already activated in any way on Steam.

If you have a modern Nvidia gfx card and the GNOME interface, you will need to be on the old X11 rendering engine not (default) Wayland. Not sure about KDE, I assume whatever X11 option exists there will work the same.
    Log out of Fedora
    Click on your username to log in
    Click the cog/gear icon bottom right
    Choose "GNOME on Xorg" e.g. see here https://docs.fedoraproject.org/ru/quick-docs/_images/configuring-xorg-as-default-gnome-session_2.png
    Log in and proceed as normal

Install protontricks
    - sudo dnf install protontricks

Grab your Steam key here:
    https://support.iracing.com/support/solutions/articles/31000165400-how-to-generate-a-steam-key

Install iRacing on Steam, note there are only three .bat files at the end of this.

Download the iRacing installer and place into an easy to locate directory if needed.
    https://members.iracing.com/download/member/noservice.jsp and click "Download iRacing Software"

run
    - protontricks-launch --appid 266410 [path to iRacing installer]

Follow all the prompts, place the install location to where Steam installed iRacing
    - usually in Z:/home/$USER/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/iRacing
    make sure to check there is no double /iRacing/iRacing/

Once installed, for now select Proton Experimental as the Steam Play Compatibility tool - though GE-Proton9-5 does work.

Click PLAY in Steam.

The iRacing login window may be too small to fit its content properly. In my case I could see and type into the top left corner of the email field.
    So I typed/pasted my iRacing email address by clicking into the bit I could see
    Pressed TAB key on my keyboard ONCE (this will focus the cursor onto the invisible password field)
    Typed/pasted in my iRacing password
    Pressed ENTER key on my keyboard ONCE

It will now prompt for downloading the tracks and cards in properly sized windows.

It may crash/exit after the download is complete. Start the game again from Steam.
